# Here is the general rundown on this project

### 1. How you accomplished each item in the criteria except for README file discussion?
I organized each idea that I wanted to put into the website into seperate Flexboxes so that way I can manage on which segment I want to focus on rather than have all in there own seperate tags. Once I segment said ideas into their own boxes I then put an ID just so I can identify on which one is being edited.
### 2. Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)? 
#### LT0: 
Using github can make it easier to not only manage your code whilst documenting your progress but also monitor who edited the code by checking the "Commits" on who and what has changed on your code.
#### LT1: 
What is the difference between using only HTML and using CSS to "stylize" your website as I initially thought that you can do that only by using HTML and CSS is more of a language only to be used for creating animations. Not only did my HTML look cleaner to look at but also all of my "stylize" codes are now on CSS which is a huge change and an improvement compared to my previous endeavour.
#### LT2: 
CSS is all about stylizing your website and I have learned that not only is the look but rather the feel of the website is affected to such a degree. Having to learn media query actually makes a difference as I thought that without it basically means that it is automatic but in most cases it will basically make it harder for the user to even look at it if not implemented. Lastly animations and transitions are not as bad as I initially thought as using simple transitions or keyframes can really change the feel of your website.
### 3. Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)?
#### LT0: 
Took a while on learning the github commands but after a couple of uses I learned it eventually.
#### LT1: 
The only hard part about this initially was linking it externally as I prefer to seperate my styles rather than implement it inline.
#### LT2: 
Positioning the elements was harder than anticipated. Each element has their own properties and trying to position them is more of a trial and error that you don't know on which one can actually affect the elements position. 
### 4. How you could improve your website in the future?
Understanding on "color theory" or on how to make good segmentation of flexboxes can be a huge change towards making a website. It is not always about animations or the interactivity but rather the feel of the website by simply looking at it can really go a long way.
### 5. Other thoughts that might be noteworthy? 
In short, the only thing that I really struggled was positioning the elements as it took me hours to finally move an element by trial and error. If I knew on what code or syntax that actually moves the element based on its properties then it would be less of a hassle.
